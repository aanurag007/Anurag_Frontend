## About the Project

This project is built using **React** and optional **TypeScript**. The primary goal is to replicate the design from the provided Figma file while ensuring smooth animations, effective use of hooks, and overall performance optimization. The project avoids libraries such as jQuery and minimizes external dependencies, favoring native web tools to maintain lightweight and performant code.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 
- **Languages**: TypeScript 
- **Animations**: CSS and JavaScript for smooth transitions and user interactions

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes
- **Smooth Animations**: Enhances user experience with well-integrated animations
- **Component Reusability**: Efficient use of React components and hooks
- **Clean UI**: Design closely follows Figma mockups
- **Performance Optimized**: Minimized library usage for fast loading and smooth interactions
